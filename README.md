# PowerBI_Business-Intelligence_Covid19-Australia
I select variables and metrics to present dashboard. They are not random value or metric, but are selected to reach the point. Each metric has its own specific meaning to indicate the current context of COVID-19 pandemic, and their description are presented in the table below:

I create three distinct dashboards to serve for three objectives. The detailed dashboards are presented in pdf file. For each dashboard, I will explain how each chart is used in dashboards.

<ol>
  <li> <b> For Global Overview</li> </b>

The Dashboard 1 shows the current global context during the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 1 providse the total numbers of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and death cases in Global overview of Covid-19. Figure 2 1 also provides geographic visualization to illustrate the distribution of Covid-19's presence across the city, state, or country. The change in colours and sizes in map visualization presents the degree of severity of Covid-19 in different regions. Based on the map, I could see that the USA, Brazil, the EU, and India suffer from the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases. BI dashboard could be filtered by Date, Country/Region, and Province/State. The filter tool help easily customize the choices and compare statistics data from different regions at a particular date.

Figure 2 presents the analyses of confirmed cases including mortality rate, recovery rate, and infection rate. Three charts show three rates with total data up to the present time while the bar chart compared the active cases with the latest deaths and the latest recovered cases. The mortality rate of Covid-19 is only 3.24% globally, but approximately 0.4% of the global population still have health issues caused by COVID-19. More than 8.5 million people who are still active cases and account for more than 29.4% of confirmed cases globally.

Figure 3 illustrates the trend of deaths cases and confirmed cases by month. August is the global pandemic peak with the number of confirmed cases and deaths sharply increasing while May is recorded as the month having highest mortality rate with 6.67%.

Figure 4 depicts the top ten countries with the highest confirmed cases and deaths and put into comparison to GDP per capita metrics. For the top 10 countries with the highest confirmed cases and deaths, only four countries, namely India, Peru, South Africa, and Iran are low and middle income countries with GDP per capita below $7000, whereas the rest of countries have high GDP per capita. COVID-19 seem to be crisis for some developed countries such as the USA, UK, Italy, France, and Netherlands.

<li> <b>For Australia context</li> </b>

After review of the global context in COVID-19 in dashboard 1, the goal of dashboard 2 is to provide insights into the Australian situations to in line with the objectives . Figure 5 shows that the COVID-19 infection has spread nationwide, and the State of Victoria has the largest outbreak in Australia.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69800336/135491447-b5715ba8-eb17-489d-9abe-108feb72c0d8.png)

Figure 6 illustrates that the mortality rate due to Covid-19 in Australia at 3.04% is lower than the global mortality rate at 3.24%, while the recovered rate in Australia at 87.07% is much better than the global recovered rate at 67.02% (See Figure 2). It could say that the Australian government and Health Departments in the states have been successful in easing the mortalities due to Covid-19.

From Figure 7 & Figure 3, it can be seen that the trend of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Australia and that of Global witness upward trend. August is also the peak of pandemic in Australia in both terms of confirmed cases and deaths. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Australia after August seem to decrease. The mortality rate of Australia has still seen to grow as opposite the trend of global mortality rate in recent months even though the mortality rate of Australia is lower than that of global.

Figure 8 illustrates that the infection numbers of women is higher than that of men. The number of confirmed cases is highest in the 20â€“49 years age group. Deaths in those aged 30s to their 100s have been recorded. Most deaths were recorded in individuals aged 80 years and over.

<li> <b>For hospital/ healthcare professionals</li> </b>

Dashboard 3 shows the correlation between confirmed cases and other factors including economic factors, climate factor, and factors related to healthcare. Regarding economic factors, Figure 9 shows that the countries having high confirmed cases are the countries having GDP per capita under $60,000. In addition, the higher the national health expenditure, the lower the confirmed cases. The data of confirmed case is more dispersed in term of higher health expenditure.

Figure 10 illustrates that the correlation between confirmed cases and the average physicians per 1000 head of population, between confirmed cases and the average hospital beds per 1000 head of population. There is no clear relationship between the average hospital beds and the confirmed cases. However, the cloud of data of confirmed cases is more concentrated when moving to the lower of number of physicians. In other words, the more physicians, the less confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Figure 11 offers more insights to the role of temperature on the outbreak of COVID-19. The vast majority of the biggest confirmed cases have an average temperature which is higher than 10 Celsius. The higher the temperature, the higher the confirmed cases. A low temperature is associated with reducing number of COVID-19 infection.

COVID-19 response work should be collaborative in all stages to ensure that the response is responsive to the local community leaders. In order to contribute and engage fully in shared decision-making, more risk prevention measures and public health approaches should be adopted simultaneously. Education people about COVID-19 should be viewed as part of a holistic risk prevention measures that prioritizes the protection and well-being of people, families and communities while preventing racism, intergenerational violence and other health determinants. Especially for confirmed cases, and even suspect cases, they need to understand why isolation and quarantine are required to protect others. No matter how well developed countries with GDP per capita, if peopleâ€™s awareness about pandemic is not heightened, the COVID-19 pandemic will have a chance to break out again. People should be encouraged to increase their frequency of hand hygiene (with soap and water or using alcohol hand rub), ensure to clean surrounding surface, and to have correct cough/sneeze custom.

Australia government should adopt measures to support and protect older groups and vulnerable groups. Elder groups should be received more attention when conducting society distance. Australia should consider to set up flexible healthcare port and service delivery to address peopleâ€™s concern about their health factors (e.g. flexible clinic hours/location with additional staffing, and points of care influenza tests). The benefit of flexible approach help hinder the spread virus infection and detect the COVID-19 cases in community. Australia government should reinforce tracking confirmed cases measure. Contact tracing should be considered as prevention approach rather than surveillance. All people who have physically contact with confirmed cases should conduct society distancing to reduce infection rate. Besides, with the tracing information, public health officials and scientists can study the ways of infection, and figure out technical solution.

The authorities needs to focus on investing in health and health services to better prevent epidemics. Along with great investment in healthcare, the number of health workers available in a country is a key indicator of that country's capacity to provide delivery and interventions. The ideal number of physicians per 1000 should be four or five. There is still too little research data on whether COVID 19 pathogenicity related to the weather temperature; however, most countries with a high prevalence of COVID-19 typically have an average temperature above 15 degrees. COVID-19 could be less flexible at low temperatures, so it is less likely to spread in cold countries. Therefore, countries with high temperatures and humidity like Australia should adopt more stringent prevention measures. The weather changes with the seasons, I expect cold weather to slow down the spread of a pandemic.

In sum, BI dashboards provide updated data related to COVID-19 situation in global and in Australia specifically. It emphasises factors which could have correlation with COVID-19 infection. There are several recommendations which are derived from BI dashboard.
