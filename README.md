# PowerBI_Business-Intelligence_Covid19-Australia
I select variables and metrics to present dashboard. They are not random value or metric, but are selected to reach the point. Each metric has its own specific meaning to indicate the current context of COVID-19 pandemic, and their description are presented in the table below:

I create three distinct dashboards to serve for three objectives. The detailed dashboards are presented in pdf file. For each dashboard, I will explain how each chart is used in dashboards.

<ol>
  <li>For Global Overview</li>
The Dashboard 1 shows the current global context during the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 1 providse the total numbers of confirmed cases, recovered cases, and death cases in Global overview of Covid-19. Figure 2 1 also provides geographic visualization to illustrate the distribution of Covid-19's presence across the city, state, or country. The change in colours and sizes in map visualization presents the degree of severity of Covid-19 in different regions. Based on the map, I could see that the USA, Brazil, the EU, and India suffer from the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases. BI dashboard could be filtered by Date, Country/Region, and Province/State. The filter tool help easily customize the choices and compare statistics data from different regions at a particular date.

Figure 2 presents the analyses of confirmed cases including mortality rate, recovery rate, and infection rate. Three charts show three rates with total data up to the present time while the bar chart compared the active cases with the latest deaths and the latest recovered cases. The mortality rate of Covid-19 is only 3.24% globally, but approximately 0.4% of the global population still have health issues caused by COVID-19. More than 8.5 million people who are still active cases and account for more than 29.4% of confirmed cases globally.
